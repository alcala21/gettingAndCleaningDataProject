=============================

This repository contains the final project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data from Coursera.

The main file in the repository is run_analysis.R; this file performs all the computations to obtain the data set *tidySet* as specified in the project objective. In order to run the file, the training and test files should be in the same working directory as the file run_analysis.R. 


The file CodeBook.md contains a description of the variables in *tidySet* and shows the calculations performed to obtain it, step by step.
